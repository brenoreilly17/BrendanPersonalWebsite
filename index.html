                It’s nice to meet you! My name’s Brendan, and I am a third-year
                undergraduate student based in Nashville, TN pursuing a double degree
                in computer science and economics at <strong>Vanderbilt University</strong>.
            </div>

            <div class="block-of-text">
                Particularly interested in technology, I am currently seeking and taking advantage of opportunities in the fields of data science, data engineering, and software engineering, and tech at large.
            </div>

            <div class="block-of-text">
                This fall, I have been working at Vanderbilt’s Institute for Software Integrated Systems on research pertaining to cloud computing and/or 5G networking, where I am building meta-model abstractions. On September 23 - 25, I attended Out For Undergrad’s tech conference in San Jose, CA, where I made connections with LGBTQ+ executives, leaders, and recruiters from high-performing companies like Microsoft, Amazon, PayPal, and Google. Currently, I am strengthening my GitHub programming portfolio by creating new apps/projects. In the spring, I will be studying abroad in Madrid, Spain, and next summer I will be interning at BlackRock’s New York City office as part of their Aladdin (Asset, Liabilities, Debt, and Derivative Investment Network) Client Services Team. I am so excited for the future and what’s in store!

            <div class="block-of-text">
                On my free time, you can find me reading in a local coffee shop, going on a run, or walking around Nashville and exploring new spots. I am also a proud member of the <strong>LGBTQ+</strong> and <strong>Hispanic</strong> communities (my mom is from Argentina!), and I am fluent in both English and Spanish.
